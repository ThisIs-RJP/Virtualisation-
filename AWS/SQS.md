#### What is SQS 
- Messaging service that helps different parts of a software application communicate with each other 
	- It's like a post office for software programs 
		- One part of your application can send a message to a queue 
		- Another can pick up that message later 
- This way, different parts of your application can work independently and efficiently without needing to communicate directly at the same time
