- Suppose you have an app that contains multiple nodes
	- Each node will have their own clusters and pods and IP addresses
- Now, we have a user that wants to access just one of these services, but there are a lot of IP addresses
- A LoadBalancer decides which of the IP's that the user want's to access so that they can use the service
